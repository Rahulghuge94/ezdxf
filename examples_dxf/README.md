DXF Example Files
=================

The example files in this folder show various DXF features as ready-to-use DXF 
files to validate DXF viewers, such as the `drawing` add-on supplied.

The scripts `"create_*.py"` are used to create additional DXF sample files by 
*ezdxf* in order not to unnecessarily enlarge the repository.
